I'm interested technologies that make it possible to make products for people, products that can make people's life easier and better.

Right now, sharpening my skills at front-end technologies, especially ReactJS, but also learning other skills in back-end and data processing. Besides ReactJS, I have professional experience with Node, Python and MySQL. A little out of the dev role, I also have worked with product design with Figma, studied some UX, participated in decisions that impacted startups' products.

I aim to someday be a Product Manager that fully understands the technical and business needs of a product that can positively impact the lives of many people.
